# Apache TomEE Embedded - JSF Branch

It's the https://github.com/luisfga/tomee-embedded/tree/jsf[jsf branch] plus a @Stateless annotated service (https://github.com/luisfga/tomee-embedded/blob/ejb-lite/src/main/java/br/com/luisfga/service/StatusService.java[StatusService]), which just show some assets on status.xhtml. It's the only addition.

Everything ready-to-run with a simple `mvn clean install tomee:run`

# Uber Jar

If you'd like to build an uber-jar from the project, simply do:

----
