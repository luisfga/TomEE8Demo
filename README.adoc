# Apache TomEE Embedded Base

It consists basically of a https://github.com/luisfga/tomee-embedded/blob/master/pom.xml[pom.xml] with tomee javaee api dependency (and some for tests), a web.xml and a index.xhtml

Everything ready-to-run with a simple `mvn clean install tomee:run`

# Uber Jar

If you'd like to build an uber-jar from the project, simply do:

----
mvn clean install tomee:exec
java -jar target/tomee-embedded-exec.jar
----

# Branches
The branches are maintained to provide a layered comparison between APIs, and are stack-built (the branches are built on top of the precedent)
